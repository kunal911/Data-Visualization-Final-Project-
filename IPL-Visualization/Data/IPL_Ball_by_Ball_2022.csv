1312198,2,16,3,KL Rahul,PWH de Silva,MP Stoinis,NA,6,0,6,0,0,NA,NA,NA,Lucknow Super Giants,Smart batting by Rahul. Gets inside the line early as Hasaranga bowls the googly on length. Sweeps it powerfully after getting under it and gets it over fine leg for a 69-metre hit.

1312198,2,17,8,E Lewis,HV Patel,KL Rahul,NA,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,Lucknow Super Giants,Lewis swings for the masses but misses it completely. What an over. The first two balls and the rest of the over were two different overs there.
1312198,2,18,1,KL Rahul,JR Hazlewood,E Lewis,NA,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,Lucknow Super Giants,Smart bowling. Rahul was all set to belt another length ball over the on side. But Hazlewood spears one full and wide outside off and Rahul can only watch it pass.

1312197,1,4,7,SV Samson,Mohammed Shami,JC Buttler,NA,4,0,4,0,0,NA,NA,NA,Rajasthan Royals,goes full on the pads and Samson picks him over midwicket. Too easy. He's in some form today

1312197,1,7,6,SV Samson,R Sai Kishore,JC Buttler,NA,4,0,4,0,0,NA,NA,NA,Rajasthan Royals,glorious from Samson! Sees width outside off and he slaps this between cover and point this time to pick the gap once again.
1312197,1,8,1,JC Buttler,Rashid Khan,SV Samson,NA,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,Rajasthan Royals,beaten by sharp turn as he looks to take him on with a big drive

Once again used his long reach to try and thwack it over the on side. But yet again, the length meant that it was out of Iyer's reach and all he could manage was a top edge. It was also the wristspin that was thrown a tad wider. Gobbled safely by Sams at cover. Kartikeya gets his MP team-mate."

Back of a length this time, not as short as the previous ball, though the line is similar, and it seemed to come in off the deck like an offcutter.
